# trendalyzer
This repository contains the basic code and data for trendalyzer.me. Trendalyzer is a tool to help users find the trending topics that are interesting to them. In a nutshell, it uses a metric of how close in meaning various words and phrases are to the category a user types in to identify recent trending topics of interest.
Missing from the repository are the word2vec language model and the file containing the google trends information, which go in the data folder within the app folder. The code can easily be configured to use any trained word2vec language model.
